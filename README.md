# Personal Project: GPTProf
## Aim: creating a webpage and PWA app that calls OpenAI API for structured test generation.

The goal is to input three variables—"theme," "studies," and "difficulty"—into a JavaScript-generated UI. This interface allows users to interact with the test by selecting the correct answer and receiving an explanation. The test itself is dynamically generated via OpenAI's GPT-4o Mini, accessed through FastAPI.

Right now, it can only run on my personal network and needs a valid OpenAI API key.
